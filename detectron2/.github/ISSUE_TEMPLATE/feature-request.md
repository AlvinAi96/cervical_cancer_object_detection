Note that you can implement many features by [extending detectron2](https://detectron2.readthedocs.io/tutorials/extend.html).
See [projects](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2/tree/master/projects/) for some examples.
We would only consider adding new features if they are relevant to many users.
