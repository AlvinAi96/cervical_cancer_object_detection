name: "Unexpected Problems / Bugs"
about: Report unexpected problems or bugs in detectron2

---

If you do not know the root cause of the problem / bug, and wish someone to help you, please
post according to this template:

## Instructions To Reproduce the Issue

1. what changes you made (`git diff`) or what code you wrote
```
<put diff or code here>
```
2. what exact command you run:
3. what you observed (including the full logs):
```
<put logs here>
```
4. please also simplify the steps as much as possible so they do not require additional resources to
	 run, such as a private dataset.

## Expected behavior

If there are no obvious error in "what you observed" provided above,
please tell us the expected behavior.

If you expect the model to converge / work better, note that we do not help you train your model.
Only in one of the two conditions we will help with it:
(1) You're unable to reproduce the results in detectron2 model zoo.
(2) It indicates a detectron2 bug.

## Environment

Please paste the output of `python -m detectron2.utils.collect_env`,
or use `python detectron2/utils/collect_env.py`
if detectron2 hasn't been successfully installed.
